Welcome to the regression test directory.

The regression tests are done in a virtual X server with a window manager.
A shell script runs commands to move the mouse, click and so on.
The script makes some screen dumps, afterward the dumps
are compared to saved correct dumps.
If all the images are equals, then the test passes.

By default, the makefile run the tests.
If you want to test only one example you can do :
	make start_xvfb  # If it is not running
	cd the_example
	../regression_test
	cd ..
	make stop_xvfb   # Most of the time you will no stop it

Regressions tests run one without cache option and one with,
in any cases the result must be the same.

The regression tests fail sometimes, so the test
ran 7 times in order to be sure they failed.

Each time an image comparaison failed, the program
asks the user if the new image should replace the old one (yes/no).
This answer could apply to all the image in this directory (yeshere|nohere).
Or to all the following images (yesforall|noforall).
The test displays the old/new image and their subtraction.
If the old image does not exist, it is created from the new image.

If the test run with a tty, when it is launched with "at" or "cron"
it will not ask questions.

A classical output may be:

notebook2 [1]0123456/0123456 {1}0123456/0123456

[1]      indicates that it is the first test with cache
0123456  indicates that 7 image dumps are made
/0123456 indicates that the 7 images are equals to the good ones
{1}      indicates that it is the first test without cache
0123456  indicates that 7 image dumps are made
/0123456 indicates that the 7 images are equals to the good ones

If a test fails, [2] or {2} will be displayed and so on until 7 retries.
