To compile and execute you need :
	- GTK 1.2.10
	- gdk-pixbuf 0.17.0

You type "make run_tests" to compile and launch the widget testing program



These sources are here to show that zero memory widget are a reality.

They are :
	- not clean
	- not documented
	- not optimized
	- bugged
	- full of misnamed variables and functions

They should not be used as a basis for a real widget library.
